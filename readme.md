# DSA in Golang

## From simple leetcode array problem to complex graphs and trees
## Also Dynamic Problems

> *This was my approach to learn a new language, I saw it on a youtube channel, he tries to learn golang by doing bunch of leetcode problem, That's a brillian approach, I too have done some similar things to learn golang (built some simple projects). But In order to become truely master at any language syntax and "think in terms of the language" leetcode (or any kind of competitive dsa platform) is s great help.*

> *I'm using this repo to keep a track of my daily atleast 2/3 dsa problems, which I've not done in any phase of my learning. (except university DAA class. hehe.)*
